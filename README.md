- 👋 Hi, I'm @Eduardo-ort
- 👀 I'm interested in: Ethical hacking and cybersecurity.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning the Java language with the object-oriented paradigm.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate with people who are on the same path as me or who know how to program in turbo c++, which is a language that I master, as well as with people focused on hacking.
